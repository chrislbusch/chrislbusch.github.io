				<h4>A Short History</h4>
				Here is a little about me.  My first computer was a Tandy TRS 80 &reg, and I loved to play Dungeons of Daggorath &reg.  I finally received 
				my first computer when I around 22, I built it with spare parts I acquired from people I knew.  It was a 486dx with 4mb memory running Windows 3.1.
				 From there I went up the OS chain and have ran every version of Windows &reg desktop version.  I have also learned several different linux distributions, mostly Debian based, such as Ubuntu, Mint, and variations of each.  I have also used Red Hat, Puppy Linux, and Suse (which I actually worked for Novell Inc.  when they acquired Suse).  I have set up web servers at home with linux distros, hosting my own website, with LAMP.  I have even ran a webserver from my Raspberry Pi.  I have done some coding in C# while in college, and some coding with an arduino uno.  My passion is web coding, as I have had mostly hardware related I.T. jobs, my current focus in 2017 is to get back to learning HTML5, CSS3, along with javascript, and frameworks.  This website is ever changing as I learn more and more I will change and add to it.
