				<h4>A Short History</h4>
				<div>Here is a little about me.  My first computer was a Tandy TRS 80 &reg, and I loved to play Dungeons of Daggorath &reg.  I finally received 
				my first computer when I around 22, I built it with spare parts I acquired from people I knew.  It was a 486dx with 4mb memory running Windows 3.1.
				 From there I went up the OS chain and have ran every version of Windows &reg desktop version.</div>
